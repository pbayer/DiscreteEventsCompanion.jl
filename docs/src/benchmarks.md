# Benchmarks

Currently you can expect `DiscreteEvents` to run medium size simulations (with thousands of events) in under 99 ms.

- `DiscreteEvents` [development benchmarks](https://github.com/pbayer/DiscreteEventsCompanion.jl/tree/master/benchmarks)
- [`M/M/c benchmarks`](https://github.com/pbayer/DiscreteEventsCompanion.jl/tree/master/benchmarks/queue_mmc): a story of how to [improve a model](https://github.com/pbayer/DiscreteEventsCompanion.jl/issues/1).
