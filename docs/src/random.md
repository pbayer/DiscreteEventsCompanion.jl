# Randomness

The elements introduced so far (clocks, events and processes) let us describe event sequences in discrete event systems (DES). In reality those sequences often show considerable randomness and come out starkly different with varying initial conditions or intervening random events.   

If we are interested in the stochastic nature of DES, we can follow Cassandras [^1] and model them as stochastic timed automata ``(\mathcal{E},\mathcal{X},\Gamma,p,p_0,G)`` where

```math
\begin{array}{rl}
  \mathcal{E} & \textrm{countable event set} \\
  \mathcal{X} & \textrm{countable state space} \\
  \Gamma(x)   & \textrm{feasible or enabled events}: x \in \mathcal{X}, \Gamma(x) \subseteq \mathcal{E} \\
  p(x';x,e')  & \textrm{state transition probability}: x,x' \in \mathcal{X}, e' \in \mathcal{E} \\
  p_0(x)      & \textrm{pmf}\ P[X_0=x]: x \in \mathcal{X}, X_o \textrm{initial state} \\
  G_i         & \textrm{stochastic clock structure}: i \in \mathcal{E}
\end{array}
```

Everything in this definition can be expressed by combining

- clock, events and processes of `DiscreteEvents`,
- Julia's [multiple dispatch](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/methods/#Methods-1) and
- using the [`Distributions`](https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl) package.

## Automata

The feasible event function ``\Gamma(x)`` expresses the fact that events are conditional on states or that in a given state ``x`` only certain events ``\Gamma(x) \subseteq \mathcal{E}`` can happen. The transition function ``\mathcal{f}:\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{E} \rightarrow \mathcal{X}`` is only partially defined on the domain ``\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{E}``.

Julia's multiple dispatch provides a powerful way to implement the transition function ``\mathcal{f}``.

The process to do it is:

1. define the event set ``\,\mathcal{E} = \{\alpha, \beta, \gamma, ...\}``,
2. define the state space ``\,\mathcal{X}=\{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\}``,
3. define the transition function ``\mathcal{f}`` as multiple methods ``\,\mathcal{f}(x_1, \{\alpha,\beta\}), \mathcal{f}(x_2, \gamma), ..., \mathcal{f}(x_n, \omega)`` ,
4. define a default transition ``\,\mathcal{f}(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{E})=\text{\O}\,`` as one method doing nothing.

Since Julia specialises its methods on function arguments, it calls the default transition function only if no proper transition is defined. This eliminates the need to check for and delete previously scheduled events.

### A server breaks down

For example if a (modeled) server `S` breaks down randomly and takes on a state `Failed`, it cannot accept a previously scheduled event `finish_job`. If we have defined correctly the transition function `ùíá(S, Busy, finish_job)` and the default transition function, the event `ùíá(S, Failed, finish_job)` triggers the default transition and is simply ignored [^2].

# to do
```

## Random variables

Random initial states, transition probabilities or random times can simply be computed by calling `rand(d)` on a [distribution](https://juliastats.org/Distributions.jl/stable/types/#Distributions-1) `d` from the [`Distributions`](https://juliastats.org/Distributions.jl/stable/) package.

### Two poisson processes

In the following example we simulate two arrival processes, one homogeneous poisson process (HPP) say for a grocery store and one non-homogeneous poisson process (NHPP) where the number of arrivals diminish over time e.g. for a bakery.

```julia
using DiscreteEvents, Random, Distributions, Plots

Random.seed!(1234)    # set random number seed for reproducibility
const Œª = 10          # arrival rate 10 customers per hour
const œÅ = log(0.2)/10 # decay constant for customer arrivals
D = Exponential(1/Œª)  # interarrival time distribution

hpp  = [0]            # counting homogeneous poisson arrivals
nhpp = [0]            # counting non-homogeneous poisson arrivals
t = Float64[]         # tracing variables
y1 = Int[]
y2 = Int[]

Œ¥(t) = Int(rand() ‚â§ exp(œÅ*t))   # model time dependent decay of arrivals
trace(c) = (push!(t, c.time); push!(y1, hpp[1]); push!(y2, nhpp[1]))

# define two arrival functions
#       |   count             | schedule next arrival
arr1(c) = (hpp[1] += 1;         event!(c, fun(arr1, c), after, rand(D)))
arr2(c) = (nhpp[1]+= Œ¥(c.time); event!(c, fun(arr2, c), after, rand(D)))

# create clock, schedule events and tracing and run
c = Clock()
event!(c, fun(arr1, c), after, rand(D))  # HPP arrivals (grocery store)
event!(c, fun(arr2, c), after, rand(D))  # NHPP (bakery)
periodic!(c, fun(trace, c))
run!(c, 10)

plot(t, y1, label="grocery", xlabel="hours", ylabel="customers", legend=:topleft)
plot!(t, y2, label="bakery")
```
