# Modeling approaches

> All models are wrong. Some are useful. (George Box)

There are different approaches in modeling *discrete event systems (DES)* for simulation. All are limiting in some way. `DiscreteEvents.jl` tries to provide you with a simple, yet versatile grammar for modeling.

## Event scheduling

Following Cassandras[^1] we can consider DES as stochastic timed automata ``(\mathcal{E},\mathcal{X},\Gamma,p,p_0,G)`` where

```math
\begin{array}{rl}
  \mathcal{E} & \textrm{countable event set} \\
  \mathcal{X} & \textrm{countable state space} \\
  \Gamma(x)   & \textrm{feasible or enabled events}: x \in \mathcal{X}, \Gamma(x) \subseteq \mathcal{E} \\
  p(x';x,e')  & \textrm{state transition probability}: x,x' \in \mathcal{X}, e' \in \mathcal{E} \\
  p_0(x)      & \textrm{pmf} P[X_0=x]: x \in \mathcal{X}, X_o \textrm{initial state} \\
  G_i         & \textrm{stochastic clock structure}: i \in \mathcal{E}
\end{array}
```

`DiscreteEvents.jl` provides a [`Clock`](https://pbayer.github.io/DiscreteEvents.jl/dev/usage/#Clocks-1) ``G_i`` and [`event!`](https://pbayer.github.io/DiscreteEvents.jl/dev/usage/#Events-1). Everything else can be expressed with Julia functions (or expressions).

Choi and Kang[^2] outline three approaches to event scheduling: 1) event, 2) state and 3) activity based.

### Event based approach

We can simply schedule Julia functions as events, possibly triggering other events.

```julia
using DiscreteEvents, Distributions, Random

Random.seed!(123)
ex = Exponential()

chit(c) = (print("."), event!(c, fun(chat, c), after, rand(ex)))
chat(c) = (print(":"), event!(c, fun(chit, c), after, rand(ex)))

c = Clock()
chit(c)
run!(c, 10)
```

This is useful when we don't have to care much about states.

### State based approach

Events are expressed as state transitions ``\mathcal{f}(x, \gamma)`` with ``x \in \mathcal{X},\ \gamma \in \Gamma(x)`` of finite automata. The following example models 8 servers as state machines serving a queue of jobs:

```julia
using DiscreteEvents, Printf, Random, Distributions

const p = 0.3          # probability of finishing

abstract type ùëã end    # define states ùëã
struct Idle <: ùëã end
struct Busy <: ùëã end

abstract type Œì end    # define events Œì
struct Load <: Œì end
struct Release <: Œì end

mutable struct Server  # state machine body
    id::Int
    c::Clock
    state::ùëã
    job::Int
end

ex = Exponential()
jobno = 1

queue = Vector{Int}()
done  = Vector{Int}()
Base.isready(x::Array) = !isempty(x)

# transition functions ùíá (can be implemented with Julia's multiple dispatch)
function ùíá(A::Server, ::Idle, ::Load)
    A.job = pop!(queue)
    A.state = Busy()
    @printf("%5.2f: server %d took job %d\n", tau(A.c), A.id, A.job)
    event!(A.c, fun(ùíá, A, A.state, Release()), after, rand(ex))
end

function ùíá(A::Server, ::Busy, ::Release)
    if rand() > p
        push!(queue, A.job)
    else
        pushfirst!(done, A.job)
        @printf("%5.2f: server %d finished job %d\n", tau(A.c), A.id, A.job)
    end
    A.job = 0
    A.state=Idle()
    event!(A.c, fun(ùíá, A, A.state, Load()), fun(isready, queue))
end

function ùíá(A::Server, ùë•::ùëã, Œ≥::Œì)       # catch all
    println(stderr, "$(A.name) $(A.id) undefined transition $ùë•, $Œ≥")
end

# setup a clock and 8 servers
Random.seed!(123)
c = Clock()

A = [Server(i, c, Idle(), 0) for i ‚àà 1:8]
for i ‚àà shuffle(1:8)
    event!(c, fun(ùíá, A[i], A[i].state, Load()), fun(isready, queue))
end

# simulate arrivals ("event-based")
event!(c, (fun(pushfirst!, queue, ()->jobno), ()->global jobno += 1), every, rand(ex))

run!(c, 10)
```

```
0.01: server 4 took job 1
0.12: server 6 took job 2
0.23: server 1 took job 3
0.31: server 4 took job 1
...
9.46: server 8 took job 21
9.48: server 5 finished job 8
9.48: server 5 took job 26
9.48: server 2 finished job 23
9.48: server 2 took job 27
9.52: server 7 finished job 17
9.52: server 7 took job 28
...
"run! finished with 161 clock events, 90 sample steps, simulation time: 10.0"
```

Note that we modeled the arrivals "event-based".

### Activity based approach

Here events are expressed as activities. We take the [example of a multi-server M/M/c queue](https://github.com/BenLauwens/SimJulia.jl/blob/master/examples/queue_mmc.ipynb)[^3] and implement it as a sequence of activities:

```julia
using DiscreteEvents, Printf, Distributions, Random

mutable struct Server
    clock::Clock
    id::Int
    input::Channel{Int}
    output::Channel{Int}
    dist::Distribution
    job::Int
end

Random.seed!(8710)   # set random number seed for reproducibility
num_customers = 10   # total number of customers generated
c = 2                # number of servers
Œº = 1.0 / 2          # service rate
Œª = 0.9              # arrival rate
arrival_dist = Exponential(1/Œª)  # interarrival time distriubtion
service_dist = Exponential(1/Œº); # service time distribution

# now we implement the activities
load(S::Server) = event!(S.clock, fun(serve, S), fun(isready, S.input))

function serve(S::Server)
    S.job = take!(S.input)
    @printf("%5.3f: server %d took job %d\n", tau(S.clock), S.id, S.job)
    event!(S.clock, (fun(finish, S)), after, rand(S.dist))
end

function finish(S::Server)
    put!(S.output, S.job)
    @printf("%5.3f: server %d finished job %d\n", tau(S.clock), S.id, S.job)
    S.job=0
    load(S)
end

input = Channel{Int}(32)  # create two channels
output = Channel{Int}(32)
jobno = 1

# this implements the arrival process
function arrive(c)
    @printf("%5.3f: customer %d arrived\n", tau(c), jobno)
    put!(input, jobno)
    global jobno += 1
    if jobno ‚â§ num_customers
        event!(c, fun(arrive, c), after, rand(arrival_dist))
    end
end

clk = Clock()
S = [Server(clk,i,input,output,service_dist,0) for i ‚àà 1:num_servers]
map(s->load(s), S)
event!(clk, fun(arrive, clk), after, rand(arrival_dist))
run!(clk, 20)
```
```
0.123: customer 1 arrived
0.130: server 1 took job 1
0.226: customer 2 arrived
0.230: server 2 took job 2
0.546: server 1 finished job 1
...
9.475: customer 9 arrived
9.530: server 2 took job 9
10.066: server 1 finished job 8
10.257: customer 10 arrived
10.260: server 1 took job 10
10.626: server 1 finished job 10
10.789: server 2 finished job 9
"run! finished with 20 clock events, 1168 sample steps, simulation time: 20.0"
```

## Process flow

In yet another view we look at **entities** (e.g. messages, customers, jobs, goods) undergoing a *process* as they flow through a discrete event system. A process can be viewed as a sequence of events separated by time intervals. Often entities or processes share limited resources. Thus they have to wait for them to become available and then undergo a transformation (e.g. transport, treatment or service) taking some time.

This view can be expressed as [process](https://pbayer.github.io/DiscreteEvents.jl/dev/usage/#Processes-1)es taking `wait!` and `delay!` on a `Clock`.

Here you combine it all in a simple function of *take!*-*delay!*-*put!* like in the activity based example, but running in the loop of a process. Processes can wait or delay and are suspended and reactivated by Julia's scheduler according to background events. There is no need to handle events explicitly and no need for a server data type since a process keeps its own data. Processes must look careful to their timing and therefore you must enclose the IO-operation in a [`now!`](https://pbayer.github.io/DiscreteEvents.jl/dev/usage/#DiscreteEvents.now!) call:

```julia
using DiscreteEvents, Printf, Distributions, Random

Random.seed!(8710)   # set random number seed for reproducibility
num_customers = 10   # total number of customers generated
num_servers = 2      # number of servers
Œº = 1.0 / 2          # service rate
Œª = 0.9              # arrival rate
arrival_dist = Exponential(1/Œª)  # interarrival time distriubtion
service_dist = Exponential(1/Œº); # service time distribution

# describe the server process
function server(clk::Clock, id::Int, input::Channel, output::Channel, service_dist::Distribution)
    job = take!(input)
    now!(clk, ()->@printf("%5.3f: server %d serving customer %d\n", tau(clk), id, job))
    delay!(clk, rand(service_dist))
    now!(clk, ()->@printf("%5.3f: server %d finished serving %d\n", tau(clk), id, job))
    put!(output, job)
end

# model arrivals
function arrivals(clk::Clock, queue::Channel, num_customers::Int, arrival_dist::Distribution)
    for i = 1:num_customers # initialize customers
        delay!(clk, rand(arrival_dist))
        put!(queue, i)
        now!(clk, ()->@printf("%5.3f: customer %d arrived\n", tau(clk), i))
    end
end

# initialize simulation environment
clock = Clock()
input = Channel{Int}(Inf)
output = Channel{Int}(Inf)
for i in 1:num_servers
    process!(clock, Prc(i, server, i, input, output, service_dist))
end
process!(clock, Prc(0, arrivals, input, num_customers, arrival_dist), 1)
run!(clock, 20)
```

```
0.123: customer 1 arrived
0.123: server 1 serving customer 1
0.226: customer 2 arrived
0.226: server 2 serving customer 2
....
9.475: customer 9 arrived
9.475: server 2 serving customer 9
10.027: server 1 finished serving 8
10.257: customer 10 arrived
10.257: server 1 serving customer 10
10.624: server 1 finished serving 10
10.734: server 2 finished serving 9
"run! finished with 50 clock events, 0 sample steps, simulation time: 20.0"
```

## Comparison

The output of the last example is different from the first three approaches because we did not shuffle (the shuffling of the processes is done by the scheduler). So if the output depends very much on the sequence of events and you need to have reproducible results, explicitly controlling for the events like in the first three examples is preferable. If you are more interested in statistical evaluation - which is often the case -, the 4th approach is appropriate.

All four approaches can be expressed in `DiscreteEvents.jl`. Process based modeling seems to be the simplest and the most intuitive approach, while the first three are more complicated. But they are also more structured and controllable , which comes in handy for more complicated examples. After all, parallel processes are often tricky to control and to debug. But you can combine the approaches and take the best from all worlds.

## Combined approach

Physical systems can be modeled as *continuous systems* (nature does not jump), *discrete systems* (nature jumps here!) or *hybrid systems* (nature jumps sometimes).

While continuous systems are the domain of differential equations, discrete and hybrid systems may be modeled easier with `DiscreteEvents.jl` by combining the *event-scheduling*, the *process-based* and the *continuous-sampling* schemes.

### A hybrid system

In a hybrid system we have continuous processes and discrete events interacting in one system. A thermostat or a house heating system is a basic example of this:

- Heating changes between two states: On and Off. The thermostat switches heating on if romm temperature `Tr` is greater or equal 23¬∞C, it switches off if temperature falls below 20¬∞C.
- A room cools at a rate proportional to the difference between room temperature `Tr` and environment temperature `Te`.
- It heats at a rate proportional to the temperature difference between temperature of the heating fluid `Th` and room temperature `Tr`.
- The room temperature `Tr` changes proportional to the difference between heating and cooling.

First we setup the physical model with some assumptions:


```julia
using DiscreteEvents, Plots, DataFrames, Random, Distributions, LaTeXStrings

const Th = 40     # temperature of heating fluid
const R = 1e-6    # thermal resistance of room insulation
const Œ± = 2e6     # represents thermal conductivity and capacity of the air
const Œ≤ = 3e-7    # represents mass of the air and heat capacity
Œ∑ = 1.0           # efficiency factor reducing R if doors or windows are open
heating = false   # initially the heating is off

Œîte(t, t1, t2) = cos((t-10)*œÄ/12) * (t2-t1)/2  # change rate of a sinusoidal Te

function Œîtr(Tr, Te, heating)
    Œîqc = (Tr - Te)/(R * Œ∑)             # cooling rate
    Œîqh = heating ? Œ± * (Th - Tr) : 0   # heating rate
    return Œ≤ * (Œîqh - Œîqc)              # change of room temperature
end
```
Œîtr (generic function with 1 method)

We setup a simulation for 24 hours from 0am to 12am. We update the simulation every virtual minute.


```julia
reset!(ùê∂)                               # reset the clock
rng = MersenneTwister(122)              # set random number generator
Œît = 1//60                              # evaluate every minute
Te = 11                                 # starting values
Tr = 20
df = DataFrame(t=Float64[], tr=Float64[], te=Float64[], heating=Int64[])

function setTemperatures(t1=8, t2=20)   # define a sampling function
    global Te += Œîte(tau(), t1, t2) * 2œÄ/1440 + rand(rng, Normal(0, 0.1))
    global Tr += Œîtr(Tr, Te, heating) * Œît
    push!(df, (tau(), Tr, Te, Int(heating)) )
end

function switch(t1=20, t2=23)           # a function simulating the thermostat
    if Tr ‚â• t2
        global heating = false
        event!(fun(switch, t1, t2), @val :Tr :‚â§ t1)  # setup a conditional event
    elseif Tr ‚â§ t1
        global heating = true
        event!(fun(switch, t1, t2), @val :Tr :‚â• t2)  # setup a conditional event
    end
end

periodic!(fun(setTemperatures), Œît)        # setup the sampling function
switch()                                   # start the thermostat

@time run!(ùê∂, 24)                          # run the simulation
```

Now we have people entering the room or opening windows and thus reducing thermal resistance:


```julia
function people()
    delay!(6 + rand(Normal(0, 0.5)))         # sleep until around 6am
    sleeptime = 22 + rand(Normal(0, 0.5))    # calculate bed time
    while tau() < sleeptime
        global Œ∑ = rand()                    # open door or window
        delay!(0.1 * rand(Normal(1, 0.3)))   # for some time
        global Œ∑ = 1.0                       # close it again
        delay!(rand())                       # do something else
    end
end

reset!(ùê∂)
rng = MersenneTwister(122)
Random.seed!(1234)
Te = 11
Tr = 20
df = DataFrame(t=Float64[], tr=Float64[], te=Float64[], heating=Int64[])

for i in 1:2                                 # put 2 people in the house
    process!(Prc(i, people), 1)               # run process only once
end
periodic!(fun(setTemperatures), Œît)    # setup sampling
switch()                                     # start the thermostat

@time run!(ùê∂, 24)
```

We have now all major schemes: events, continuous sampling and processes combined in one example.
