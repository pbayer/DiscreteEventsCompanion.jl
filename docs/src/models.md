We have seen different approaches in modeling *discrete event systems (DES)* for simulation. All are limiting in some way. But `DiscreteEvents` provides a simple, yet versatile and powerful grammar for combining them.

- **Event scheduling**:
- **Activities**:
- **Processes**:
- **Automata**:
- **Actors**:
