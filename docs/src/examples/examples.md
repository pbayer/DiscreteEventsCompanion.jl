# Examples

The examples should show how to use `DiscreteEvents` and how to employ and combine different approaches to modeling and simulation.

- [**Table tennis**](tabletennis.md): a state-based simulation,
- [**Single server**](singleserver.md): an activity-based simulation of a single server,
- [M/M/c queue (activity)](queue_mmc_act.md): an activity based simulation of an M/M/c queue,
- [M/M/c queue (processes)](queue_mmc_srv.md): process based simulation of the M/M/c queue,
- [M/M/c queue (state machine)](queue_mmc_sm.md): a finite state machine of it,
- [M/M/c queue (actor)](queue_mmc_actor.md): an actor implementation with `YAActL`,
- [**Post office**](postoffice/postoffice.md): a process-based simulation of a
  post-office,
- [**Goldratt's dice game**](dicegame/dicegame.md): a simulation of assembly lines,
  illustrating what can be done with multiple simulations and parameter variation on
  parallel threads,
- [**House heating**](house_heating/house_heating.md): a simulation of a hybrid
  system, combining all three schemes: events, continuous sampling and processes.
