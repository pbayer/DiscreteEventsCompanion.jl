# Example programs

example programs are explained in the [documentation](https://pbayer.github.io/DiscreteEventsCompanion.jl/dev/)

- `chitchat.jl`: basic event scheduling
- `server.jl`: a state machine example
- `queue_mmc_act.jl`: an activity-based model of a M/M/c queue
- `queue_mmc_srv.jl`: a process-oriented model of the M/M/c queue
- `queue_mmc_chn.jl`: yet another M/M/c model (slow!)
- `tabletennis.jl`: a state machine simulation of a game
