# Example programs

example programs are explained in the [documentation](https://pbayer.github.io/DiscreteEventsCompanion.jl/dev/)

- `chitchat.jl`: basic event scheduling,
- `server.jl`: a state machine example,
- `queue_mmc_act.jl`: an activity-based model of a M/M/c queue,
- `queue_mmc_srv.jl`: a process-based model of the M/M/c queue,
- `queue_mmc_srv_fail.jl`: a process-based model with failures,
- `queue_mmc_sm.jl`: a state machine model of the M/M/c queue,
- `queue_mmc_actor.jl`: an actor model,
- `queue_mmc_chn.jl`: yet another way to model it (slow!)
- `tabletennis.jl`: a state machine simulation of a game
