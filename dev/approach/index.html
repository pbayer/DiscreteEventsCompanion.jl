So if the output depends very much on the sequence of events and you need to have reproducible results, explicitly controlling for the events like in the first three examples is preferable. If you are more interested in statistical evaluation - which is often the case -, the 4th approach is appropriate.</p><p>All four approaches can be expressed in <code>DiscreteEvents.jl</code>. Process based modeling seems to be the simplest and the most intuitive approach, while the first three are more complicated. But they are also more structured and controllable , which comes in handy for more complicated examples. After all, parallel processes are often tricky to control and to debug. But you can combine the approaches and take the best from all worlds.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Combined-approach-1" href="#Combined-approach-1">Combined approach</a></h2><p>Physical systems can be modeled as <em>continuous systems</em> (nature does not jump), <em>discrete systems</em> (nature jumps here!) or <em>hybrid systems</em> (nature jumps sometimes).</p><p>While continuous systems are the domain of differential equations, discrete and hybrid systems may be modeled easier with <code>DiscreteEvents.jl</code> by combining the <em>event-scheduling</em>, the <em>process-based</em> and the <em>continuous-sampling</em> schemes.</p><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="A-hybrid-system-1" href="#A-hybrid-system-1">A hybrid system</a></h3><p>In a hybrid system we have continuous processes and discrete events interacting in one system.
